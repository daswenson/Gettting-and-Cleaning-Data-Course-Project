Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

# Modifications

## the original data was modified by the following

* Merging the training and test sets to create one set
* Extraction only the mean and standard deviation measurements
* Using descriptive names for the activities in the data set
* Labeling the data set with descriptive variable names
* Creating a independent tidy data set with the average of each variable

# Identifiers

* `subject` - The ID of the test subject
* `activity` - The type of activity performed when the measurements were taken
